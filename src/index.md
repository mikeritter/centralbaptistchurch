# Preaching the Good News

Central Baptist Church is a Christ-centered, Bible-based fellowship. We want to exemplify the grace of God in our everyday lives through obedience to the will of God.

We diligently seek the Master's smile through expositional preaching and traditional worship. With so much confusion and uncertainty in our society, we need a clear and uncompromising message from the Word of God, which means preaching and teaching the Bible and not about the Bible is our only salvation.

We understand the God given role that families play in our church, and seek to strengthen fathers as the principle leader in the family. We welcome family worship and encourage family time through limited activities and teaching.

## God Wants You to Know All who trust in Jesus Christ alone have eternal life.

> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.Romans 6:23

### No one deserves the gift of eternal life — because everyone is a sinner.

> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Romans 3:23

### There is a penalty for sin.

> For the wages of sin is death Romans 6:23

### God has provided the only solution — Jesus Christ.

> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8

### Personal faith in Jesus Christ is the way to receive eternal life.
